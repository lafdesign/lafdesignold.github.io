			<h1> 
		Cannot keep in step:  July 19, 2009
			</h1>
			<p>
				
				<br>
				<br>
				let me give you this one new page<br><br>
				where old pages end<br>
				where know what lay forgotten was so not<br>
				forgotten not and could be <br>
				when oceans shine sunrise<br>
				take the gold lift from the waters<br>
				rise and let be that pass you over us<br>
				back past back left what had fair<br>
				had left behind<br>
				<br>
				Where will our haunted sorrow go?<br>
				I dare not blame you <br>
				so come of banished sorrow not less I blame you<br>
				come from altered and forgotten mountains<br>
				<br>
				For only did this moment I realize <br>
				for you to be with like dream to my life<br>
				less no life you bring to another<br>
				less not no infant life and a life of another kind<br>
				 <br>
				Fair be not that the sun did rise today <br>
				forever it will rise and over the ocean<br>
				<br>
				Fair that love did banish me <br>
				for all that I am it did banished <br>
				the revolution of the earth and season meant nothing to be<br>
				<br>
				 So, for when others can lavish in their desires I cannot<br>
				they lavish because they can and it feels good to their emotion<br>
				so, but they have a lifetime of it <br>
				taken from me -so now that I command the texture of it-<br>
				<br>
				Where some lives can lavish in the experience of emotion<br>
				I create it and so to for will I always make that choice to<br>
				<br>
				So, but when and where others are rewarded for their love <br>
				with bonds, and so are rewarded with life and infants, children to love<br>
				They grow old having filled themselves<br>
				I cannot have hate for them <br>
				for then to would my forgiveness of my own love be a contradiction<br>
				<br>
				Space and time cross out and reach by day or moon light,<br> and only fairly speak I can for I cannot see and if I can it fails to make sense <br>
				<br>
				For all that I am cannot neither be not not be made sense of <br>
				how can that be<br>
				how could we let go<br>
				let go<br>
				throw it to the floor<br>
				and let be<br>
				<br>
				someone who cannot be <br>
				for that cross the lake fresh waters there is some like place and life I cannot compete with<br>
				I can not compete with cast mirages and empathy and empty theories. <br>
				<br>
				who would choose metaphysics over a family <br>
				because having that kind of love <br>
				nothing can be like it <br>
				not good love can my love ever be<br>
				<br>
				my dreams have such movements in moments but my art in step cannot keep <br><br><br>
