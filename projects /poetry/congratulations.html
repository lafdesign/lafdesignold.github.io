			<h1> 
						
				Congratulations:  January 1, 2011
		
			</h1>
			<p>

				<br>
				<br>
				revolutionize to bridge,<br>
				depressions deepen them-<br>
				 the water flows over<br>
				come- by that which spans them-<br>
				overcome for march on we go<br>
				<br>
				caravans not destroyed- by every hazard on the road<br>
				 where small things start<br>
				 after them will come yearning <br>
				 their extensions<br>
				    -ribbon folds-<br>
				Do you have no concept of the future?<br>
				<br>
				find them all, <br>
				those nemeses- No!<br>
				all your friends- No!    -hardly there to find <br>
				you'll find it's trial by error<br>
				your plight is in your guilty eyes! <br>
				<br>
				that's the dark water of the fallen<br>
				simply an empty pit<br>
				-the lost-<br>
				fill like water the ocean<br>
				on the edge<br>
				 situated to become lost- <br>
				-Some draw!    huh?<br>
				<br>
				Time-less things  -you never know <br>
				why does the moon look beautiful tonight?  <br>
				don't let it go I will absolutely say it<br>
				don't let it go I will absolutely say that <br>
				you and I we have a lot of things to do with our lives<br>
				they just make their body motion:<br>
				 they just happened that way <br>
				 when the dreams fall back asleep:<br>
				 isn't like they happened for the first time-<br>
				I know why they crossed the ocean-<br>
				 and it's just like that they go back again.<br>
				<br>
				wasted over nothing like 30 cups of alcohol- <br>
				I had what was someone's dreams in hand<br>
				it was a fooling thing to do with them <br>
				between fingers they ran<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				set back<br>
				 everything has paid the price <br>
				what are your plans for life?<br>
				 -it's got some for you <br>
				I would tell you not to worry<br>
				 but that would be a bad lie<br>
				<br>
				how did we let our-selves believe<br>
				we know what was there before us?<br>
				 our ideas:<br>
				 would some-how escape us <br>
				<br>
				Reckless-Beings, led astray road what we see isn't it!<br>
				<br>
				Reckless-being: <br>
				think that thinking the future will be better is wrong-<br>
				 and you are wrong<br>
				<br>
				Reckless-being what you are is where you get it <br>
				see a shooting star outside chaos there<br>
				 they are, others, where, (in the place) you are not<br>
				<br>
				act, organize things, work to do concepts labor for them, <br>
				 - congratulation -<br>
				regular bodies do not exist! <br>
				thinking: every range of discussion -could be- is everything-<br>
				who was willing to <br>
				delete everything,<br>
				delete everything,<br>
				start again.   <br>
				<br>
				 who-many were nothing?<br>
				 how long after I hope the feeling passes- <br>
				with the generation! <br>
				Who protects their own cohort?<br>
				for-whom-for were they protected by? <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				Who could not shelter rising?<br>
				everyone can't say what's going to be said<br>
				everyone, who, can't say they understand.<br>
				<br>
				polities running sideways for years<br>
				 finally just, stoop, stood there <br>
				unmoving [cities] and accepted its own aesthetics<br>
				ugly like a son from a mother, he drinks and drinks - <br>
				beget spoiled in the womb<br>
				un-sheltering became its pleasure<br>
				who own but one night, maybe another <br>
				who never rose above what her ugly sister, ingenuity, couldn't put out!<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				I smell you, lonely traveler: said the lion:<br>
				 come join your numbers <br>
				feed cement poor concrete pour it over <br>
				open windows but shut them in!<br>
				and when you close your eyes <br>
				trying not, oh, to make it so bad, scream. <br>
				windows air out.  <br>
				<br>
				the doors can be unlocked opened blinds <br>
				what's there is there to see<br>
				like it or not, spectacles become dry- forever gone<br>
				praise the city,<br>
				 discrepancies- will become known, Yes!<br>
				<br>
				truth will be told-- truth will be told-- truth will be told, <br>
				-speak- and lose it again.<br>
				<br>
				Walking, even from disaster, never was bad<br>
				-mentality, health, culture and its slime: <br>
				the wheel turns round never ends <br>
				( I thought about you into the morning )<br>
				 not much to sleep in <br>
				who can say buffalo many times...  do you know what I mean <br>
				 to nature, <br>
				to persona <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				your dreams will follow you to that place <br>
				thunder let you roll!<br>
				for a moment Fell!<br>
				 feel absolutely safe, you <br>
				the hunter in the sky tracks you- <br>
				oh, sky! <br>
				your thoughts are also in those nebula, far off dust<br>
				and it glows, swirls mass- <br>
				cannot -help -light- escape it <br>
				-light and go- <br>
				given a container to fill yourself reiterated by clouds <br>
				<br>
				your cut finger as you hold <br>
				you slip on the water fly through the<br> 
				dark air dark air<br>
				you clutch my breast tight <br>
				you smooth with your hand <br>
				crime is the calling in warm summer's land <br>
				bust in and abolish and nothing is left <br>
				find them! <br>
				the phantom so prone to appear<br>
				 warm summer puddles pools of tears: dry them <br>
				thought-fully -so entirely <br>
				warm-summer fold them like letters and slip them- <br>
				not to day nor tonight<br>
				 choosing among thoughts-words-anything that flashes <br>
				you: see is, voice says: <br>
				wind- you coward air and breath you let be spoken <br>
				how you let sound more <br>
				though you behind out of sight:<br>
				<br>
				you gave up secrets you don't know who is wind <br>
				you cast down transform <br>
				you carry spoken <br>
				how subverted you we did <br>
				what you know you are <br>
				that which the sun removes, <br>
				the daylight hides <br>
				holds down like the wind blows the snow<br>
				or trees grab the land <br>
				hides like - in the winter, the virid leaves do-<br>
				the dive and form leaf to leaf renew <br>
				at least signaling the passing of time<br>
				clashes symbols, start and stop in duration -<br>
				like hill top to hill top <br>
				and Fall! <br>
				from there after into the valley<br>
				  forest- river- forest and up hill side, Aim up!<br><br><br>
