				Sure poem:         December 24, 2009
			</h1>
			<p>
				
				<br><br>Be it fair that the sun did rise today?<br>
				up over the forests, the leave less trees.<br>
				Yellow roar like an army hail of arrows <br>
				came down before up rose<br>
				 that orb<br>
				 to call victory over <br>
				the earth and night<br>
				<br>
				And you did sleep unbeknownst to me<br>
				like blankets covered vale by snow <br>
				<br>
				you were <br>
				where that besiegement by the sun <br>
				was to take me<br>
				one year I give myself to find you<br>
				as another year has passed <br>
				by no longer measure than the year before <br>
				<br>
				I have but dreams to follow to you<br>
				-your mischief in my dreams<br>
				<br>
				Be it that the sunlight did break out-<br>
				break away- from the cloudy sky <br>
				daylight minute by minute <br>
				under-which you will find me<br>
				less I find myself here, <br>
				again on the solstice of this passing year<br>
				be that it will become a memory <br>
				or you will have interrupted these lines <br>
				<br>
				What chances I take! <br>
				 they are great,those chances <br>
				it is my will to do so and to for-fill the chances of another <br>
				I can shroud my symbolism like a lock <br>
				 and no-one can undue it<br>
				unlocked and understand <br>
				the symbolism but <br>
				you make no effort to move against it, it simply fell before you<br>
				as trembling in dishabile I stand <br>
				alone but unscathed<br>
				 less for my bleeding mind <br>
				my trembling hands raised poised against old age<br>
				<br>
				will you rise to call my name<br>
				will you unfreeze, dis-suspend from time<br>
				brush off the snow and find me here<br>
				or will you brush past the sensory receptors I have placed for you to find me by<br>
				(lets say we found each-other if you reach me through a painting)<br>
				though if be it that you were just some scrupulous detail on a canvas<br>
				my lip would quiver at the thought of that <br>
				<br>
				If you were after all just the wind<br>
				 I would not sand to hear<br>
				  wail wind by my window <br>
				fair be it more than just the wind you are <br>
				or I beseeched the world for nothing <br>
				after all this; screaming words at the air <br>
				like a gun with blank shots to hear but nothing is felt<br>
				no fallen foe symbolizing victory<br>
				no forceful power to fall foe by <br>
				but my words are not aimed at some foe external to me<br>
				it is up to me I am fairly sure to be the one to make it happen<br>
				my capacity is to realize dreams every one that haunts me I will to find them <br><br><br>
