			Tova my Monster:  April 2009
			</h1>
			<p>


			               
			Part 1<br>
			<br>
			Take memories, unfold them-<br>
			time and space; words control them-<br>
			tapestries and installations-<br>
			art, and sun-day trailing conversations <br>
			<br>
			You leave only echoes behind<br>
			foot-steps in this hill-side city<br>
			-dancing down hallway streets, in the snow-<br>
			 wild wind, soaked by rain and charred by fire-<br>
			<br>
			We stormed those institutions-<br>
			We stole their relics-<br>
			-to parade them-<br>
			the songs we sung: they resounded out across the open air<br>
			 <br>
			We coalesced in where everything we ever wanted was-<br>
			seeing our dreams- out slowly- as they happened<br>
			<br>
			Can we not say we did forge what happened?<br>
			We did craft, we carved, as if we could regret the choices that we made-<br>
			If we were solid stone that edifice would bear our names<br>
			<br>
			But reach our lips- it was Tova, to who I owe everything<br>
			and but only can give back, again, memories unfolding-<br>
			Being not small wrinkles, being not on the edges-<br>
			these lines run-cross the pages<br>
			<br>
			You are the binding of a book that cannot be the book of shadows<br>
			Your generation by means of some majestic manipulation<br>
			bestow the brilliant -vibrant colors, in and of your-self you did imagine <br>
			<br>
			So, but you can dust off this town<br>
			not because the bricks and streets do not glisten any longer<br>
			they only shine dull in comparison to what you can remember-<br>
			[remember, discover by imagination] <br>
			<br>
			 Our memories are stars, far off suns<br>
			and they are orbiting celestial bodies<br>
			whom now and others someday will transcend us<br>
			<br>
			So, but we were - for just a moment,<br>
			I met you, a thousand revolutions of the sun from today<br>
			 I knew you longer<br>
			 -measurements being not whatâ€™s wrong<br>
			just our imaginations' sensations stronger-<br>
			Our birthdays corresponding to<br>
			 the only solstices and equinoxes- <br>
			The calendars that matter only to each other<br>
			I laugh and pray I knew you one year longer<br>
			<br>
			The paint isn't fading; the colors- <br>
			only splashes<br>
			-we will see those reverberations <br>
			far off in the distant future<br>
			-we will be- remember<br>
			-our memories unfolding<br>
			<br>

			Chanting like a favorite trance tech-no <br>
			-blue-glass bulbs, glazed with electricity<br>
			screams and lies and angry crying eyes<br>
			-we were the liars and the screamers <br>
			our eyes rain cried-<br>
			<br>
			 Fear not the day -nor the coldness of the nights<br>
			  not blindness nor sickness, nor -<br>
			   fear to loose the motions of the moon.<br>
			 Looked out over and across any empty city<br>
			we seemed to be as guards, over its happening<br>
			-the grand constructions of our dreams<br>
			-the branches of our night-mares <br>
			<br>
			Vacationing only to find- how awful being alone is;<br>
			dragging ourselves, or being dragged-<br>
			 never finding a convincing argument <br>
			<br>
			We wanted to be those innocent children-<br>
			on the playground, swinging, running,<br>
			-pushing shoving up over fences <br>
			hiding in-between the bushes-<br>
			We wanted to find everything new for one last time-<br>
			venturing out into the early morning for nothing<br>
			-and being satisfied, all alone, being untamed in the morning-<br>
			<br>
			Realized by archaic rituals <br>
			-feeling cast by shadows, contained to the moonlight-<br>
			we saw together the rooms filled with nothing <br>
			we tripped down the same iron staircases,<br>
			-onto the shore, into the cool waters<br>
			-we were soaked by night time<br>
			<br>
			So, but we built it as a city on a hill<br>
			<br>
			By those-same ethics,  which drive us,<br>
			so do condemn us<br>
			As like the Aztecks who were driven-<br>
			-out into the mist and glacial lake-fresh waters<br>
			<br>
			So drift out, unfold memories, blow away dust the<br>
			-ashes, throw the colors in the waters<br>
			From your balcony remember -waves of prayers-<br>
			<br>
			So many things happening-so-quickly <br>
			the lines are being drawn-still, yet moving<br>
			-a platform far above the battle<br>
			enshrined by relics,  -a space created-<br>
			for a ritual, which is life, <br>
			-the clock-work beneath skin<br>
			<br>
			Part  2<br>
			<br>
			As the sun rises over me in this place,<br>
			as the sun rises and as the sun sets <br>
			I sit and I wonder in which slowly does move me<br>
			<br>
			Out across the airways, over roads, <br>
			through and in-between the buildings<br>
			in the jungles of far off places<br>
			<br>
			We have seen the temples destroyed<br>
			we have seen the tops of mountains <br>
			where the ruins stand, as they are-<br>
			fallen, sinking into the earth<br>
			images of what all our people did once imagine<br>
			<br>
			All is stone surfaces, the iconography<br>
			captivated mental states<br>
			the vision, the sensation, those explicit symbols,<br>
			glyphs which are to their creators, after-life<br>
			<br>
			So, but they had no conception-<br>
			we would remark them as mental- <br>
			yet only the hard rocks retain them<br>
			their solidity is static,  and life is too fluttering<br>
			to smash our skulls against the solid rock walls.<br>
			Our signification is not in-graven <br>
			we exist in the mental states we touch<br>
			-care not if we create them, worry not if they persist <br>
			-our signs will be there, breathing, contemplating on the open airways <br>
			<br>
			There is delirious chaotic rhapsody<br>
			  -delivering oats and vows and prose on those <br>
			   rooftops and railways, riverboats and blow<br>
			  away the dust of the past<br>
			<br>
			Part 3<br>
			<br>
			How much more we love each other than we love ourselves<br>
			I would push you up the latter, <br>
			 save you as chaos ensued the rooms behind<br>
			I climb up-after knowing you are safe<br>
			<br>
			Underneath the surface we only have the choices we made<br>
			outcomes from options-<br>
			doorways in a shifting architecture <br>
			<br>
			We navigate to find each other <br>
			sometimes the framing holds- <br>
			us captive<br>
			-we imagine, we convince ourselves-<br>
			punishable by conceiving<br>
			-that no reason did contain us<br>
			<br>
			I will stamp my foot and bring about an earthquake<br>
			before I choose to leave you, <br>
			before I climb the latter and do not stop <br>
			when reaching top the trees-<br>
			I will enter chaos-<br>
			I will drive crazy madness<br>
			emptying the air-out the windows<br>
			blowing smoke extinguishing the fire <br>
			colliding down stare-cases<br>
			<br>
			The demolished hill-side<br>
			the screams of un-dead voices<br>
			their movement in the shadows<br>
			longing voices, flashing lights<br>
			blue-lights, siren red and yellow<br>
			headlights, red, green  - and yellow<br>
			and those that radiate soothing rainbows<br>
			of colors in  a slow precession, a hypnotic beckon<br>
			-to set the battle, to wake the warriors, <br>
			-to predict the future <br>
			while all the time fire-works exploding <br>
			<br>
			 Cast shells and make sacrifices<br>
			orient by signs and symbols<br>
			approximate the space with tokens<br>
			    draw- out the cosmos in the sand<br>
			-command the ears to listen<br>
			-place the relics on the alter<br>
			 -and rise - a mountain top<br>
			attain redeeming, en-lightened power<br>
			command the air to clear<br>
			<br>
			 All is still surfaces and noises and looks and stares<br>
			  and movement beneath the skin breathing in<br>
			  rhythm yet breathless, yet gasping<br>
			 choking and drowning<br>

			  Now dangling off balconies, wavering<br>
			    and blowing prayers off into<br>
			   the night over roads and rooftops and across<br>
			     the water<br>
			<br>
			  Tear down tapestries and installations of<br>
			   memories unfold blow out candles and<br>
			   away the ashes down stairs slam-door<br>
			  hold back tears and do not extinguish the fire<br>
			    which burns the rooms behind<br> <br> <br>
