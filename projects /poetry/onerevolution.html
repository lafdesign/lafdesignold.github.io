			<h1> 
			One Revolution: May 2009
			</h1>
			<p>
									


				<br> <br> From nothing I imagine<br> 
				No reason not to run and branch<br> 
				with fractal shapes like ink runs<br> 
				free on wet paper<br> 
				There is nothing that contains me<br> 
				All we know we should free<br> 
				  and let be wild<br> 
				Let all our understanding be and so ourselves be wild!<br> 
				<br> 
				Let us block set, so to print<br> 
				Only so to smear it all away<br> 
				free ink and so let be free on pages<br> 
				they will be the exclamations of our days<br> 
				freed but onto each other we will laugh as we brush<br> 
				all once we knew away<br> 
				Be it reduced to ash -all we once did know<br> 
				Be it reduced to ink and paper<br> 
				and thus only lack the infinity of water<br> 
				<br> 
				I am captivated by the seasons<br> 
				I am entokened to the land that signifies me<br> 
				Satisfy the land does not me<br> 
				nor the words that seemingly I impress-<br> <br> 
				Run free!<br> 
				<br> 
				Let be what will begin<br> 
				Let be that march unto ashen ends<br> 
				Let be that wrong road follow<br> 
				So, be it not wrong until discovered<br> 
				that the choices we faced were free<br> 
				So be free and I will follow<br> 
				So die, for I will-<br> 
				Be ashes, I will be-<br> 
				If washed away and so will I be-<br> 
				If you are words I will match them-<br> 
				Set letters and I will press them-<br> 
				If you are the ink, I will be but a brush stroke away<br> 
				<br> 
				Water, if it free you to be<br> 
				 Ink, formless, an ossculation between what is thoughts and what is words and<br> 
				what is spoken, said, undone confusion;<br> 
				testimony that was given up, to and about<br> 
				floating unconscious in the waters of the mind<br> 
				echoing and lightning up-<br> 
				    connections, webs and networks of thoughts<br> 
				<br> 
				 The grand machine,<br> 
				   how you are not fair!<br> 
				and though I will fair, do speak I can<br> 
				And I wonder in which does move me and I imagine<br> 
				provocations that-are still standing<br> 
				fleets of ships that are burning<br> 
				people who are losing and aging and are no more<br> 
				<br> 
				Why cant you be real?  Why philosophy is as true as its taken to be<br> 
				<br> 
				These words are about you and I<br> 
				When together, how we argue-<br> 
				And when apart they echo in my mind<br> 
				arguments would tear apart so many kind<br> 
				How rips apart families<br> 
				How wade into war<br> 
				How tear to insanity<br> 
				Philosophy is not princess over sciences<br> 
				yet she does not cut cheaply into lives<br> 
				Our arguments some day insulate<br> 
				and it is in this sense that I rely on you<br> 
				to deconstruct out space and time<br> 
				Remove me, for I am captive by a world that no longer gleams<br> 
				I have forgotten the wild and am amidst the forest as so speaking<br> 
				Will you speaker out your voice and return to the wind<br> 
				your words, your free style-?-<br> 
				I cannot help to see it in your eyes<br> 
				And so irrational I speak!<br> 
				How can it be rational<br> 
				I beg the question; tell me?<br> 
				<br> 
				For someday I will not to answer<br> 
				my will be lost<br> 
				like all those surround me<br> 
				Everything is lost until found the strength<br> 
				I will exact upon the diss-aligned<br> 
				but I am!  You have the quality of strength<br> 
				to be set about in this writing,<br> 
				its not rational to imagine<br> 
				‘something new’ its hard to pre-suppose existed before it happened-<br> 
				By time the planet spins around the solar system<br> 
				one revolution,<br> 
				<br> -things could be completely different<br> <br> <br>
