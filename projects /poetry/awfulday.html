			<h1> Awful day:   September 4th  2009
		
			</h1>
			<p>
				<br><br>
				This day was awful. <br>  
				Awful, it is the only word that I can say to describe it.<br>
				  Awful- like the rain is; from a cloud, <br>
				it cannot be blamed when it comes and doesn't.<br>
				  Yet, so awful is a drought.  So, but untimely storms sweep us away,<br>
				 down the hillsides and racing into lakes, oceans, or up into the air. <br>  
				<br>
					Day by day, as some ceremonies require smoke, others hill sides, <br>some paper money, sheets to hold the prayers: <br>
				 We are the benefactors of the ceremonies we commence, whatever they are for.  <br>
				  This is the beginning of something now and until the end of the coherent account of it can be given.<br>
				  This ceremony, today- begins with water, by lakes the thousand tons that is their bodies.<br>
				    So-like the rain is this one day; it hangs in the air, it forms tributaries-<br>
				 the streams of thought that flow out to fill a lake, they feed the oceans.<br>  The water came from the life here and is the feeling that today brought me.<br>
				<br>
					What grows up has been touched by the light of the sun.  <br> 
				 It is star-light that sun is and I wish it to have the consciousness it allows for. <br>  
				 The sun is owed recognition, it lacks a self too.  <br>
				 what we love here cannot be let go of even if it cannot speak and has no self. <br>
				  The rain cannot speak or tell a story but my storm can speak<br>
				It is when I am sleeping and when I am in the morning it is all that life treats me to.   <br>
				<br>
				I will fall from this life hand in hand with the next one.<br>
				Will your hand lead me there?<br>
				Will you follow with me to the end?<br>
				For if you -wave your hand, I will follow you to where does take you out to go.  <br>
				Do you see it - you - are waters, lakes, the oceans if I am standing on the side of you. <br> 
				I may be standing on solid grounds but you are the waters that I speak to when I pray, <br> when I wash or when I commit to ash some paper money so to ceremoniously pay,<br> for you, your body of fresh or salty, vapor or ice; you are the water.  <br><br><br>
