			<h1> 
				Tribute to Sarah: 2006
			</h1>
			<p>

				<br><br>Do you remember last spring sprawled in your car in harmony this is where it all begins?<br>
				 Recognizing everyone we saw and seeing no one we knew<br>
				 except for chatty and the monkey, which crawled out of your radio and onto our backs <br>
				and wild rides with water-windshield wipers off. <br>
				<br>
				Countless car crashes. Human clashes. And miles of ashes. <br>
				Those trees filled our lungs and eyes and our minds. And left our souls <br>
				burning in the basements of those citadels. <br>
				Ashes on lashes and lust to dust. <br>
				<br>
				And the tears from the sky seem like a sign but they fall on everything and nothing at the same time.<br>
				 We may search for and never find what we have here in this green valley. <br>
				The jungle the rain and the fiery eyes and cries and screams and lies and dreams.<br>
				 And we were the liars and the screamers and the criers.<br>

				 You’re the princess here. You’re the beggar and the bag-lady with your car and yellow ski goggles.<br> You’re the sidewalk sitting coffee sipping townies.<br>
				 You are every stare and soul in harmony,<br>
				 wild raw temptation desperation.<br>
				 And you were ordained here. Time stands still and wavers at our command here-<br>
				in this valley rivers waterfall and green. But the earth shifts under us and hands beckon from places far.<br> And we leave this place these trees the streets and feats and heaps of memories behind. <br>
				A place like this we may never find. <br>
				We only have one quiver one arrow one bow one swift let go. <br>
				<br>
				When the world burst open the pieces fell crashed and resounded in euphony.<br>
				 And as the dust was swept away there was left an echo of utopia <br>
				even if it was only a singularity and hopeless that there is no more. <br>
				<br>
				Do you remember those green tea mornings through Guilford?<br>
				 Spoonful after spoonful until school felt like a good idea.<br>
				<br>
				Then the snow came and the blows maiming and beating me into the scarlet frozen ground.<br>
				 And I walked my backpack all around this godforsaken town <br>
				until my feet began to walk right on the ground. <br>
				And the virid forest walks and the brave romantic talks and the shame of the sudden ending game <br>–as the players threw the board and the pieces to the floor.<br>
				 And a happy birthday call threw a face against a wall as I lay in bed burning my way to sleep. <br>
				I woke dead the next day and so in bed I lay. But you were brave enough to come -<br>
				prop me up and make my heart beat. <br>
				<br>
				Why do we go there every day? At first only for a vacation but now away we stay. <br>
				We travel there in cars. In bedrooms under midnight blankets.<br>
				 We travel there from rooftops and trains on broadbrook <br>
				and new years and on broken and forgotten bridges. <br>
				<br>
				Remember sitting every day in school- so out of fuel.<br>
				 And the dry-cleaned books. And the dry-eyed looks. <br>
				And the driest minds and the driest times. <br>
				<br>
				Remember my scarlet wax letter I left on silver cars <br>
				in the shadow of a brick mountain- a grave stone and a monster of the past. <br>
				<br>
				Remember the bark and wood I drilled holes in for those wondrous thrills.<br>
				<br>
				And the dancer thin and tall whose epigraph in harmony adorn the walls a travesty of therapy or graffiti.<br>
				<br>
				Me and you walking up the avenue to feed my truck with oily muck.<br>
				 We call his name but no help came. We walked so far to feed my car. <br>
				<br>
				And seeing every car a squad car every time we drive.<br>
				 Knock on cedar because they’re shooting up churches anyway.<br>
				<br>
				Remember when you were Dorothy and you rose so high in your balloon.<br>
				Remember when you were Madonna and you rocked and rolled all night in dress <br>and swimming in murmurs and colors and blending rolling tones.<br>
				Remember when you were Alice and you tripped down your rabbit hole to the wonder inside-<br>one big one small with monarch madness and crawlers sprawl. <br>
				Remember when you were Daisy and you woke up from breakfast at tiffany’s and decided to ferociously socialize <br>until we sat under green light on doorsteps at Emma's watching the grass run and being watched from those doctor’s eyes. <br>
				Remember when you were Joan of Merlin, maid of the rain. <br>Your self up island branches canonized by the burning canopy light and the ashes falling lit to the waters.<br>
				Remember when you were Helen of troy and I didn’t notice when you left and you returned- <br>faced with a thousand burning shipwrecks. <br>
				<br>
				Remember when you were the black widow and you wondered how you would eat the gazelle<br> even though you knew killing it wouldn’t be a problem. <br>
				<br>
				Last winter do you remember winding roads to wild parties with tie-dye walls?<br>
				 You sitting cramped on a couch wide eyed in wonder more than I ever have seen<br>
				<br>
				Were you at the debutant black and white at the nights inn? <br>Like all those other dances we were rolling over the music and the crowds. <br>
				<br>
				The poverty of the people. Poor from their fastfood. Dreary from their democracy. <br>
				Starving bathed in the captivating tv glow. They mass huddled in houses cars and parks. <br>
				Dying from what they don’t know and starving from what they do.<br>
				 They are lost but all is not.<br>
				<br>
				 Their children will live. Poor from population and pollution. <br>
				Dreary from their disheveled and dissolving governments. <br>
				Starving climbing out of the darkest holes. <br>
				The machine is on the fritz contemplating life and death.<br>
				 Fearing both and having none.<br>
				 And the rain. Rain tears rain sorrows rain pain. <br>
				Macbeth spots won’t wash away. Our albatross in blood does lay.  <br>
				<br>
				Whatever happened to those tissue doves? <br>
				Pay homage to the fallen capitalists and the rise of capitalism. <br>
				You’d have run out of paper before you finished.<br>
				 You’d have run out of hope before that. <br>
				<br>
				Before the door of this prolific house the raving crow hops away not afraid to fly. <br>
				Go away you lunatic and rabid man.<br>
				 And the cellist in her chair- at her song we blankly stare. What was she thinking? <br>
				<br>
				The morning walks through snow canonized in the streetlamp glow- just to see you wake. <br>
				Do you feel we’re wasting time with our bonsai state of mind? Do you fear it too?<br>
				 Do you feel so all alone reaching cross the telephone? Cause I feel it too. <br>
				<br>
				Do you know the utter cold walking all the way from home just to see you.<br>
				 You in that black dress that night (your vitality filled the room and everything- <br>pressing and 
				pushing on the walls) too demonically divinely perfect. <br>
				I sat at home collecting bones and imagining you bushwhacking your way onto a nightmare. 
				<br>
				Do you remember the mindless city? The bombs must have scared the people away or into the god’s house. <br>Do you remember the pedophile preacher? A king father and a decrepit fool. <br>
				Once again you stayed up all night writing for the paper when no one else would. <br>
				And in the conference I missed the Secretary’s song because I was being interviewed for the tv.  <br>
				An entire night city to parking garage around in and all I was left with was the taste of cherry. <br>
				My mind rolled away in the airport but my disemminded body was guided by three disembodied voices <br>until you shooed them away like flies. <br>
				<br>
				Remember the pizza cowboy’s girl. The princess of push. <br>
				Stumbling out of every forest, ally and crawling our of every ditch and car.<br>
				 Always everywhere and never anywhere.<br>
				 And her fat cat with piercing eyes and down dog. <br>
				We all owe him our thanks and gave him our money.<br>
				<br>
				And repentance we did find in the contemplating mind.<br> 
				And atonement we did need as the lies began to bleed. <br>
				<br>
				Remember the demigod from New York <br>
				who Drew up from his bag a month worth of time by the pound.<br>
				 Driving to the city for burning Marlboroughs. <br>
				I drew the short straw and was dared by NY’s finest to display my stone working skills for you and the eyes of the mason and before a million tons of water and one small essential fire. <br>
				<br>
				Where do the railroads lead? Where we walked so many times to get away but never to go away. <br>
				Where does that blue glass bridge reveal? What would happen if we didn’t just take the boat around the town- <br>reached the end and turned around. <br>
				Where would we be if we climbed down the other side of the mountain or if we didn’t stop climbing when we reached the top of trees. <br>
				<br>
				And when we leave how will we go? In tears? With wild anticipation? <br>
				Will it come quiet or will it crash in cacophony?<br>
				 And which way will our tornado grow: Will it swill to a pinnacle point and extinguish-<br>
				 Or are we only a moment away from the advent and gaining momentum?<br> 
				<br>
				The teeth of the world are grinding down on us more than ever.<br>
				 And its hard to imagine a future where the bullies are so easily appeased. <br>
				<br>
				Thanks for holding my head back from the surface of my pool of tears. <br>
				You should just tie my head back with string- or rope-for my head is heavy. <br>
				 <br>
				And how long do we have on this god-forsaken rock? Until the sun goes out. <br>
				A billion years and counting. Not really forever and hardly an eternity. <br>
				<br>
				Did you know we’d die here in this valley?<br>
				Unbeknownst it’d be this afternoon- how it came so soon<br>
				Then it hit me- all its might- last night in Sarah’s room<br>
				Our lives are ending here tonight   and everything we know will change <br>
				All our hopes and all our pains will stay here in this valley waterfalls <br>
				And green walks and cemetery talks will live on here in this valley <br>
				And we will be here too-<br>
				But tomorrow my flesh will rise and the person sitting here has died-<br>
				In ashes you will rise too<br>
				<br>
				We could stay here grapple ropes and live on here with dreams and hopes- <br>
				And we will stay<br>

				Who we are will live on forever <br>
				In the mists and morning rides- screaming down slopes and dissipating into the morning light<br>
				<br>
				Who we are now will live on forever <br>
				here they are the solitary souls caught in the limbo of anticipation <br>
				which is the event horizon now<br>

				Who we are tonight will live on forever…. <br>And when you repunzle your way to harmony after dining with every family’s ghosts <br>
				you will interrupt these words and we will go forth forever <br>
				<br>
				but tomorrow I will be dead <br>
				my body will rise and ashes will fall <br>
				and you will rise too<br><br><br>
