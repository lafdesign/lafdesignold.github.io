			Maitreya: April 23, 2009
		
			</h1>
			<p>
				

				<br><br>My hand,  I hold you in the air and so wave fortune.<br>
				Be not out of grasp, my fortune!<br>
				Shimmer mirage of image there-<br>
				Set forth by more than what I constitute-<br>
				fortune you can no longer be a ghost<br>
				You can respond to me<br>
				I wave my hand as to command you<br>
				Fortune I am here. <br>
				<br>
				How can it be that you take the form of my dreams but I cannot take you to my life?<br>
				I devoid myself of sleep to catch you awake<br>
				The air will shimmer<br>
				sometimes it does crackle like electricity<br>
				flash and flicked <br>
				Yet never fortune throw you to me<br>
				<br>
				My ears will not ever stop to listen,<br>
				for that when fortune drop you <br>
				the air will carry;<br>
				the ground will stop you<br>
				in explosion so fortunate enough that I may hear.<br>
				<br>
				Understand my superstition lays untouched to my philosophy<br>
				my mind holds one while my gestures signify another.<br>
				Those are the movements that now and others someday will transcend us.<br>
				<br>
				Touched by superstition <br>
				decayed by madness <br>
				this is the beginning.<br>
				<br>
				Let me use my metaphysics <br>
				my rhymes and riddles won't convey this<br>
				to en-graven with your likeness<br>
				A sense thats growing stronger <br>
				so to constitute you<br>
				I call you to existence <br>
				<br>
				I can incant you<br>
				If I find you<br>
				before I die, to make the gestures<br>
				You will break apart the world<br>
				You are the water<br>
				And so I be your night<br>
				and you be daylight<br>
				I will past, your future<br>
				I fast and pray in your honor <br>
				If you so shower me and enlighten the world<br>
				<br>
				Will you yield to me this night, Oh Fortune?<br>
				You have the power to incarnate, to maintain them<br>
				if I lay the symbols in the sand<br>
				 <br>
				My Fortune do you hear me?<br>
				I call upon the one I love...<br>
				<br>
				The heart that beats in me <br>
				I can not help it;<br>
				and my prayers are not to gods but to you<br>
				My superstition is you<br>
				My philosophy and heart beat sing for you <br>
				the listener who I imagine;<br>
				Your whispers captivate me- <br>
				like unwinding rhymes and rhythms  <br>
				a slow percussion as every word is folding <br>
				and every line and syllable <br>
				will wash away all fear<br>
				<br>
				I cannot help but wonder why each day each tide of souls that passes <br>
				By whose fortune does bring them, if not our fortune-?<br>
				Of whom I speak freely of and do not fear cold destiny <br>
				Stop my heart or clot my blood, destroy my brain and I will be in no less harmony <br>
				Not ever less than this moment can I ever be<br>
				<br>
				 Be it a wiser majesty, my own fortune,<br>
				will be realized by my spoken words<br>
				by breath and in here and now<br>
				<br>
				Fortune make it be not longer <br>
				Say they have forgotten already <br>
				they have forsaken always<br>
				the coolness of the waters<br>
				And I can not even but myself bring <br>
				the hand to tears nor calm the storm- <br>
				 electricity beyond the horizon<br>
				<br>
				Fortune stop spinning!<br>
				realize the material to listen<br>
				be that spoken air transcend us<br>
				cleans blood and flesh with clean waters<br>
				<br>
				Manifest by fortune, secured by fate<br>
				Like gravity, the sun<br>
				Manifest the philosophy to stop for a moment, <br>
				the sun; so we can transition <br>
				from fortunes darkness into the light <br>
				I will be in darkness until I join you in the next life<br>
				I fear the darkness now will not make it to the next age<br>
				I worry not if life persist but I worry I will miss this world<br>
				Here and now and this moment<br>
				it could be as I cast symbols <br>
				Only to now wait and see <br>
				the sun will illuminate them<br>
				and fill the depth that I engraved them<br>
				<br>
				O’ fortune I say the measurements are perfect<br>
				the last drop to the brim<br>
				which I dare say was my own tear<br>
				It can be that this world falls in fortune’s light<br>
				and still not interrupt the next mortal life<br>
				<br>
				So, but revision philosophy now and in perfect balance<br>
				lay the future, not disrupt it<br>
				Be not where the future lay now!<br>
				I can see it <br>
				You, fortune, are the future<br>
				I can lay open for you the awful past<br>

				Fortune you set this world into motion<br>
				I once thought I did control your manifest<br>
				your mandate I may have never to possess<br>
				In habituate the darkness; I confess to you<br>
				Lake waters, far off stars, predicates of the mind<br>
				You speak to me, fortunes spins and my hands tremble<br>
				The voices scream and my vision moves like life intoxicates me<br>
				<br>
				The matter of my bones are dust when enlightened<br>
				you can stand dust and ashes<br>
				as you, the light, blows them away<br>
				And so I will be at fortune’s darkest moment, flesh?<br>
				With the glyphs drawn in the sand to see you<br>
				This come rising morning<br>
				From whence I will rise un-slept <br>
				to carry out a lifetime <br>
				to find you manifest in symbols<br>
				or in flesh and in the light<br> <br>

				I know my thoughts and prayers do reach to you <br>
				for all that you are I know<br>
				You’re there, you curve and bent the time and space <br>
				All our matter orbits around the moment your light rises<br>
				and is raining<br>
				<br>
				Let light be admits the air today and not against it<br>
				let me thrive the darkness or so expose me<br>
				End the past now so the prophesy has ended<br>
				before the need of it does end-<br>
				End it, the need<br>
				Take my flesh to do it<br>
				but do not just let darkness juxtapose <br>
				the dark past.<br>
				<br>
				Fill the air with light, sun!<br>
				Show my skin is just the philosophy I make it to be<br>
				The sweet taste on my lips<br>
				The impression of death<br>
				Be it all those things I take it to be<br>
				realized by archaic rituals you will be<br>
				and somewhere far off, so will realize another<br>
				<br>
				Come so to transcend us light and break apart the world<br>
				Here and now so many do away you; They need not to forget<br>
				Through the darkness they can see not to know<br>
				Fortune cannot but hardly sound to those who careful listen<br>
				My loudest yells are echoes to you<br>
				<br>
				Fortune- Do not let this time slip<br>
				I cannot command you not to <br>
				Let go!<br>
				Let break apart what may <br>
				and in the last minute lay philosophy in pieces<br>
				and so to all the world revision<br>
				<br>
				Hand I waver, touch the air before me <br>
				the gestures will follow through the air to reach you<br>
				<br><br><br>
