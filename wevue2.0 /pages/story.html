            <h4 class="story-header">The Idea</h4>

            <p>Here I am at this great event, holding my smartphone in the air to record the moment. I pause for a second, breaking my gaze away from the amazing performance in front of me, only to see several hundred people around me doing the same thing. Phones are in the air everywhere. So I had to ask myself, why is it so important to me and everyone here that we engage in this ritual? We want to capture and preserve this moment, but is this really the best way? If we all have a common desire to film and photograph this shared experience, shouldn’t we have a way to share these digital memories together? Abso-freakin-lutely. With nearly the same effort, we could all enjoy this amazing moment from thousands of different perspectives. The result is not just more content posted to your social network - but a shared album where we can see an experience from the perspectives of everyone who was there. Now I can enjoy this memory from your point of view, and your point of view, and yours and yours. #BOOM. And WeVue was born. </p>

            <h4 class="story-header">The Goal</h4>

            <p>When you’re feverishly waving your phone in the air, you are trying to capture a fleeting moment you experienced with those around you. The person next to you could be a total stranger, but when he holds up his phone to take a picture, you now have something in common. The goal of WeVue is to connect the digital devices we use to capture images and video so that we can crowdsource and create things together, not just by ourselves for our social networks. We look forward to the day when you don’t have to hand a stranger five phones to take your group picture, because you know that one phone is enough to get that moment into a shared album on WeVue.      </p>

            <h4 class="story-header">The Plan</h4>

            <p>We set out to create the best crowdsourcing tool on the planet. We recruited a team of designers, developers, marketers, and investors to help us build our rocket ship. We’ve just finished polishing it up and launching it into orbit in the app store. Now we’re working with amazing companies and organizations to help them share their memories and bring them back to life. The next step is making sure WeVue albums are ready for any of life’s moments. </p>
