<h1>Fiammetta Di Liscia</h1>
<div class="lead">Lead Analyst, Consulting</div>
<div class="body-copy">
<p>Fiammetta joined AlphaSights as an intern in 2012 after graduating from University College London with a First Class degree in Economics and Politics. Before joining AlphaSights, Fiammetta worked at the United Nations Development Programme in Buenos Aires and at Baltika Group, Estonia's largest retailer. She grew up in Buenos Aires and lived in seven different countries before the age of 20. Like many of our people, she has a very international outlook. She is fluent in four languages, which she is able to use every day at AlphaSights.</p>

<p>Best AlphaSights moment: "Finding out we were the third fastest growing company in the UK. I am incredibly proud to have been part of that."</p>

</div>
</li>
<li class="js-video-description" style="display: none;">
<h1>Courtney Bell</h1>
<div class="lead">Associate, Capital Markets</div>
<div class="body-copy">
<p>Courtney is an Associate in AlphaSights' Asset Management Practice Group, having joined the firm in January 2013. Previously, she worked in Edelman's enterprise technology division and before that, spent a year working for a non-profit helping refugee populations in Uganda. Courtney graduated with honors from the University of Illinois' College of Business in 2010, where she was a four-year letterwinner and captain of the women's varsity soccer team. She is originally from Bainbridge Island, WA.</p>

<p>What are you most excited about in terms of AlphaSightsâ€™ future? "That despite how much we've grown over the past few years, we aren't even close to having reached our potential."</p>

</div>
</li>
<li class="js-video-description" style="display: list-item;">
<h1>Gabriel Harris</h1>
<div class="lead">Senior Associate, Operations</div>
<div class="body-copy">
<p>Gabriel was one of the original members of the AlphaSights New York office and was an integral member of the consulting team from the start. He joined AlphaSights after leaving JRK Property Holdings in L.A. and transitioning back to the east coast. Now, Gabe runs AlphaSights US Operations. He graduated from Union College in 2010 with a degree in Psychology and was a member of the Varsity Swimming and Club Rugby teams. Outside of the office, Gabe is a passionate skier and cyclist. He also sings with the University Glee Club of New York City.</p>

<p>What itâ€™s been like to witness AlphaSightsâ€™ growth from the beginning: "Itâ€™s crazy to think that just 3.5 years ago it was 4 of us in a small room figuring out how to drive things forward. Weâ€™ve done so much in so little time. The most exciting part is the massive scale at which weâ€™re discussing growth. I donâ€™t think we couldâ€™ve have imagined this 3.5 years ago."</p>

<li class="js-video-description" style="display: none;">
<h1>Jane Lee</h1>
<div class="lead">Lead Analyst, Consulting</div>
<div class="body-copy">
<p>Jane joined AlphaSights London in January 2013 and was then transferred to the HK office as the 6th hire. Jane graduated from King's College London with an Upper Second Class degree in Law as well as gaining a Distinction on her LPC at The College of Law. Before joining AlphaSights, Jane worked at a corporate law firm in Seoul having also interned at the Korean Ministry of Justice. Jane grew up in the UK but frequently travelled back to Seoul and Tokyo where her family is based.</p>

<p>Most memorable AlphaSights moment: "Seeing the HK headcount double in a year and having to locate new office space as we just got too big for the old office! It is amazing to be part of this journey."</p>
