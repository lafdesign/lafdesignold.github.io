			<h1> 
		 I was in a cemetery, you were in mind:    October 23, 2009
			</h1>
			<p>		
				<br><br>
				I can see you are the rain that falls at night<br>
				I can see it -you are moonlight<br>
				that reflection on the dew; the grass,<br>
				cool beneath our feet<br>
				<br>
				Its the hallow edge of time <br>
				tick the hour clock and go away you<br>
				I need it not be beckoned forth<br>
				for this reason:<br>
				humans were born here<br>
				humans died and were buried <br>
				the stone's mass toss and turn <br>
				-[even they cannot stand forever]<br>
				<br>
				I want you to go out<br>
				burn up -so that you feel no loss in feeling's less<br>
				  the earth will shake the sun will<br>
				  rise up- over again and over, <br>
				Where will you be- out there?<br>
				<br>
				I will not let you be forgotten<br>
				 so when you die<br>
				our memories will not be<br>
				left to the rubble that cannot keep<br>
				-no names that wash away<br>
				-no noises<br>
				-no moss and earth raised up<br>
				-no one-hundred years spent after we die<br>
				-living not in children<br>
				-no-<br>
				beings not there- nor will you<br>
				come again as <br>
				running animals or something awful <br>
				-your life - if you give me <br>
				your hand- will be<br>
				as I give you my hand <br>
				 -in the here and now<br>
				And so forth will we live in this moment<br>
				until the sun fails to rise<br>
				the moon fails to set:<br>
				for a hundred years long winter waits behind<br>
				<br>
				Part two:<br>
				<br>
				Raise from the ground<br>
				 all those who are gone <br>
				for fear them not<br>
				they are so let them be-<br>
				for all they are I know they are- <br>
				their apparatus reach above the ground<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				This place is a grave land<br>
				lights flash to illuminate the <br>
				sour and uneven earth<br>
				interspersed strangely small trees<br> 
				<br>
				I have not the strength to move against it <br>
				the metaphysics are not mine<br>
				but in them I share with you,<br>
				<br>
				I can not be more further from your eyes than you make me out to be and go, <br>
				predicate where I go with your mind<br>
				and you follow me out there because for what feeling were you looking for?<br>
				<br>
				What but the sensation that is the circumstance of our commotion <br>
				that your mind follows me-<br>
				I track you with my dreams at night<br>
				and am ready for when in you are there<br>
				I will shroud you in the metaphysics <br>
				that cloak the stars <br>
				though they be it not your body<br>
				 though they be it not some dreams <br>
				I will move over, trace you, when mention to me <br>
				<br>
				my metaphysics <br>
				Let be what will change you<br>
				for all that I <br>
				know your there <br>
				when the rain came and the  moon-light shown you <br>
				thought that before that if it fails you now <br>
				you will only widen your eyes more<br>
				before that <br>
				dawn came <br>
				<br>
				Let me elaborate with what strength I have left, my metaphysics.<br>
				<br>
				I will not end this- a sad story<br>
				I won't look at you any more but your not dead<br>
				your who I imagine and so we never speak<br>
				and what tells me you are there ?<br>
				I see your smile, I see your lips part, you face at me<br>
				this is to good to be not some dream - a sad feeling<br>
				<br>
				your metaphysical to me <br>
				your a story that I tell myself <br>
				its not fair that nothings there<br>
				so, less this moment passes <br>
				its you and I who let it go-<br>
				<br>
								<br>
