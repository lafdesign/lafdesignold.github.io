			The Marina: May 23, 2009

			<p>
									



				<br><br>So many memories are now only mine<br>
				So many people, they no longer are amidst the house-<br>
				that-saddens me for the new faces have no reason to remember <br>
				<br>
				I do not wish to consecrate them <br>
				Why are they not here?<br>
				and, so they tackle me in my dreams <br>
				and I remember and long to be<br>
				taken back in time to once again be with them<br>
				for one more warm summer, <br>
				one more evening <br>
				one more time on the lawn <br>
				where and when the parties were lit with torches<br>
				the mulch-en ground turned to stone<br>
				where on warm evenings the dark-night became a best friend<br>
				where the spiders hung from the walls and dropped from the ceilings<br>
				for the lights-were always on <br>
				the road sign was as big as it could be<br>
				the boats could wash away or sink but never were going anywhere<br>
				at the Marina  <br>
				<br>
				Funeral parties, wedding parties, search and rescue parties; and the regatta of boats- <br>
				lady bugs and green sea-monsters- ship wrecks and the sinking of the â€˜belle from hell<br>
				Remember that it was not always like-this<br>
				or just remember the roses <br>
				giant bushes- pieces of which still survive - somewhere else<br>
				skeletons of once did stand there still <br>
				while passing days turns pages<br>
				where we make our reservations <br>
				and the computer has us all there<br>
				any one could come back, pop in and aloha she still works<br>
				and remembers <br>
				How the silent glass rooms haunt me at night<br>
				How it feels strange to be alone there <br>
				as if the air and dust still did vibrate <br>
				-was infused with echoes <br>
				-roaring laughter to the ear<br>
				-with the interspersed shrill cackle<br>
				some screams, shrieks and cries <br>
				<br>
				It did seem like the walls would crumble from the outside,<br>
				as if the duck would into the river fly<br>
				the big white goose only exists now in memories <br>
				off ski jumps in big balloon heated tents<br>
				garlic festival, garlic brownies, garlic wine<br>
				how the relics in the attic and the photos in the office <br>
				haunt my mind <br>
				<br>
				We could simply float the house like a boat<br>
				we could take her down the rivers-<br>
				to warm weather in the winter- <br>
				so we can rock and roll all night <br>
				we can land and pick up <br>
				who we miss now <br>
				on our way there. <br>
				Come now, we are open lunch and laugh, launch your boat here <br>
				guest dock, fly in, tie up<br>
				the wind may rock you<br>
				the atmosphere may shock you<br>
				exactly like this- is no other kind<br>
				<br>
				Some day when will wake and life be different<br>
				-Does this mean that our dreams will be?<br>
				All the people who chose to leave-<br>
				For not of need of shelter nor food<br>
				they packed their bags and flapped their wings'<br>
				 and off into the night breeze flew -[were they longing to be different] <br>
				Did they chose to be?<br>
				<br>
				Their names are only words I speak <br>
				Or, were they always only words?<br>
				So, but I miss their touch that fades into dark pain<br>
				The empathy I feel <br>
				And for each other and in-between there are more than simple names for things <br>
				and others unsaid<br>
				others dead and buried,<br>
				ashes or invalid <br>
				or grown into something different <br><br><br><br>
