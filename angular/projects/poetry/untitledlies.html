			Untitled Lies: January 14, 2009
			</h1>
			<p>
									


				<br><br>Know my broken heart lies, destined to be. <br>
				So, but all the trying should never have been undertaken<br>
				For the outcome would have been the same.<br>
				<br>
				Remain unchanged. Un-altered. As I remember. <br>
				Would be deception... As it occurs, the difficulty is in seeing the grammar and noticing the rules that govern. <br>
				After, the difficulty is forgetting the pattern as it happened. <br>
				<br><br>
				Reverberations of an echo  <br>
				being the fabric of dreams <br>
				Extends and stretch out the void red darkness <br>
				forever-over again and over<br>
				<br>
				Being unsatisfied, left a broken record, <br>
				unattended to as-if forgotten.<br>
				there still is music, a melody to happen. <br>
				It does not take a bold lover to show and reveal <br>
				in order to see everything unfolding<br>
				that is now cloaked in darkness <br>
				and hardly shown <br>
				<br>
				Realize all along those few moments were everything<br>
				and at the same time realize what it means to be a human <br> 
				<br>
				Almost dying, coming close to the edge  <br>
				only to see the same vision <br>
				of being in a dream<br>
				<br>
				So where is the edge of this dagger?<br> 
				 where will the red blood drips reveal?<br>
				remember being frightened by trains<br>
				remember leaving something valuable behind<br>
				lost only to be found<br>
				stolen, only to remember and have forever. <br>
				<br>
				Know my broken heart lies, destined to be.<br><br> 
				So, but also know why I keep it hidden <br><br>
				somewhere that I think is safe but isn't.<br><br>
				<br><br>
				<br><br>
				Know my heart lies broken, jumbled.<br><br>
				As it always has-happened before <br>
				<br>
				So, with its breaking, <br>
				no-longer generating within me fire, <br>
				cutting losses for what they really are, <br>
				ropes to far off stars<br>

				Connections that will never again happen <br>
				as they were transcendent and only for a moment <br>
				in the here and now.<br>
				<br>
				We all will continue like clockwork <br>
				We all will age gracefully<br>
				We all will find lovers whom we do not know now<br>
				and do not expect to ever find.<br>
				Notice things that have been there <br>
				all along and bear witness to life happening<br>
				and lighting up our faces in the far off distant future<br>
				 and in the far off distant past, <br>
				like burning shadows <br><br><br>
