			<h1> (Blue Lion Poem)  Winter 2008

			</h1>
			<p>

				 <br><br>Contemplating off nights from off balconies<br><br>
				   extend songs and memories a lifetime-<br>
				   in realizing only once a flower<br>
				<br>
				 In my life I have been sheltered and cloaked-<br>
				  and brought out to see the world which belongs to me<br>
				<br>
				 Into the cold streets at night, into the cities<br>
				  up into the fortresses of doomed people<br>
				  fallacies of cement and machine longing to be touched<br>
				<br>
				 Rip off the cloak reveal the clockwork chest beneath<br>
				  hearts seize in distaste gorge eyes to see<br>
				 I felt so gorged and destroyed<br>
				    so left alone<br>
				  cold to walk aimlessly at night and cry<br>
				  for no way out. Blink and <br>
				  eyes only tears are left<br>
				  with the warmness and tingle of sensation which is life<br>
				<br>
				 Tear down tapestries and installations of<br>
				   memories unfold blow out candles and<br>
				   away the ashes down stairs slam-door<br>
				  hold back tears and do not extinguish the fire<br>
				    which burns the rooms behind<br>
				<br>
				 I fear not the day nor the coldness of the nights<br>
				  I fear not blindness nor sickness I fear not <br>
				   to loose the motions of the moon.<br>
				<br>
				 I am bound here and bound to become<br>
				    unwound here<br>
				 While waiting our minds become unbound<br>
				    unwound we hear the crazy<br>
				<br>
				 our own stories sing out as unbound and crazed<br>
				   voices unwinding conversations -a cacophony only loosely<br>
				   and figuratively tethered<br>
				<br>
				 There is conquest calling captives of hope and<br>
				  dreams and frames beyond grasp.  Gated alloy ally<br>
				    ends narrow passages of lost and forgotten friends<br>
				<br>
				 There is delirious chaotic rhapsody<br>
				  delivering oats and vows and prose on those <br>
				   rooftops and railways, riverboats and blow<br>
				  away the dust of the past<br>
				<br>
				 There is haunting honor always there is a<br>
				  singularity of hope forgotten hope lost<br>
				  hope forever have for always there is<br>
				  darkness to only juxtapose the light<br>
				 depressions in the valley shows the peaks their<br>
				   mighty height<br>
				<br>
				 all is still surfaces and noises and looks and stares<br>
				  and movement beneath the skin breathing in<br>
				  rhythm yet breathless, yet gasping<br>
				 choking and drowning<br>
				<br>
				 all is still spinning - orbiting celestial bodies<br>
				     slowly slip away -slink sickness  and insanity<br>
				   Institution and individual defeat. eaten and digested<br>
				    by a machine<br>
				<br>
				 all is still lost intangible confusion<br>
				   dousing text forever forgotten as a theme of history<br>
				    wage war and only war and still be lost<br>
				<br>
				   hack away coughing lungs ash for<br>
				  morning pills night ones too rolling off<br>
				     the tongue<br>
				   piercing echoing crash and shatter<br>
				<br>
				  Softly dying slowly suffering cold smoking<br>
				   wrapped in blankets seated standing shivering<br>
				  to keep warm at night home we go-<br>
				     alone we go<br>
				<br>
					Anything to make a heart beat?<br>
				      Anything to make it go?<br>
				          laughing café? movie show?<br>
				<br>
				   Pound or crack my chest, diffuse or circulate<br>
				     my blood my heart is in arrest.<br>
				<br>
				  This is my own and only life—I have but<br>
				   one arrow one bow one swift let go<br>
				<br>
				    Best aim your sight right:<br>
				<br>
				   Draw the tenseness in the string<br>
				         hold your wrist and figure right and know which<br>
				      foot to lead with-<br>
				<br>
				  I once had all the time between<br>
				    these valleys rivers waterfalls and green<br>
				<br>
				   We were ordained here -where memories and time<br>
				   stand still and wavers at our command here <br>
				   leaves and trees and forest walks and long and brave <br>
				    romantic talks about this place we will<br>
				    never find<br>
				<br>
				       Tripping in cars down railway on buses on<br>
				   mountains in plains over bridges rusty water<br>
				  over snow and into mud and darkness and terrible forests and<br>
				    into the morning<br>
				  <br>
				   Every morning in low traveling off mountains<br>
				  into afternoons in harmony and down down-<br>
				  pick up drive and turn around<br>
				<br>
				  Now dangling off balconies and wavering<br>
				   tapestries and blowing prayers off into<br>
				   the night over roads and rooftops and across<br>
				     the water<br>
				<br>
				    We only save each-other listen intently<br>
				       to stories and hear only the voices of friends<br>
				        and see only faces we know or do not want to<br>
				<br>
				   We march we trudge we curse the same streets<br>
				   we sing in summer and in spring we dance them<br>
				    wearing out lines and soles,  stories and<br>
				     sayings conducive to explosive laughter and endorphin<br>
				<br>
				     Anything to keep going?<br>
				     to keep the night at bay we<br>
				   laugh as time brushes these thoughts and memories away <br><br><br>
